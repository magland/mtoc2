/* mtoc2 runtime helper: compute the iteration count for a numbl-style
 * `start : step : end` range as a non-negative `long`.
 *
 * numbl evaluates the count as `floor((end - start) / step) + 1` and
 * clamps to zero when the range is empty (start past end with the
 * given step sign). The same formula appears at every range-emitting
 * codegen site (single-slot slice reads, multi-slot slice setup, slice
 * range writes, and MakeRange); routing through one helper centralizes
 * the cast and protects against undefined behavior when `floor(...)`
 * returns a value outside the `long` range.
 *
 * Returns `0` on:
 *   - non-finite floor result (NaN — e.g. step = 0)
 *   - empty range (negative count)
 *   - count that doesn't fit in `long` (clamped rather than aborting:
 *     the user gets an empty range, which is the safest fallback
 *     under static translation — a 1e19-iteration loop is almost
 *     certainly a typo).
