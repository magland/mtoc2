/* mtoc runtime helper: deep-copy a real tensor.
 *
 * The returned tensor owns a fresh `real` buffer (memcpy'd from the
 * source); `imag` is NULL since the caller statically knows the
 * source is real. Used by codegen to honor "copy on every
 * manipulation" — every tensor-by-name read and every user-function
 * tensor argument is wrapped in this helper, so the receiver always
 * gets an owned tensor.
