/**
 * JIT entry point for sibling consumers (e.g. numbl's executor
 * registry) that want to compile a single user-function
 * specialization on demand instead of running mtoc2 as a whole-program
 * AOT translator.
 *
 * Bypasses the script-level driver (`translate.ts` / `lowerProject`)
 * and produces an emitted JS module that returns a factory
 * `($h) => specFn`. The caller evaluates the source with
 * `new Function(source)()`, invokes the factory once per spec to bind
 * its I/O hooks, then calls `specFn(...args)` per dispatch. Per-call
 * dispatch has no I/O setup cost.
 *
 * The `lowerer` argument is the JIT spec cache: passing the same
 * `Lowerer` instance across calls means `Lowerer.specializations`
 * accumulates compiled IR across the session, so repeated calls to the
 * same `(funcDecl, argTypes, nargout)` triple skip the lowering cost.
 *
 * Caller responsibilities:
 *
 * - **Strip `exact` before calling.** Runtime-observed scalars should
 *   arrive as opaque-sign types (`scalarDouble("unknown")`,
 *   `tensorDouble(shape)` without exact data) so that `f(1); f(2);
 *   f(3)` doesn't shard the spec cache by value. `compileSpec` runs
 *   `withoutExact` as a defensive second pass.
 * - **Treat lowering errors as JIT bailouts.** `UnsupportedConstruct`
 *   and `TypeError` from the lowerer propagate to the caller as the
 *   "decline this JIT proposal" signal — the caller falls back to its
 *   interpreter for that dispatch.
 *
 * The emitted module includes every spec currently in
 * `lowerer.specializations` (not just the entry spec), because the
 * entry spec's body references its transitively-called specs by their
 * mangled cNames. Dead specs from prior compileSpec calls are bounded
 * by `MTOC2_MAX_SPECS_PER_FUNCTION` and don't affect correctness; if
 * profiling shows the re-emit cost dominates, a future change can do
 * a reachability walk over the entry's IR body.
